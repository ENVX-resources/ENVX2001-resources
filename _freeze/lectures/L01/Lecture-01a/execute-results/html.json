If you choose to watch the recordings, understand that academic decisions (e.g. review of exams) will be made based on your attendance records for lectures and labs.\n2. **Labs**: Mandatory, 80% minimum attendance required. Attendance will be taken by QR code. If you miss a lab, you may attend another session that week -- send us an email!\n3. **Tutorials**: Self-guided (1 hour), complete before each week's lab.\n\n\n## Assessments\n\nCheck [Unit Outline](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/ENVX2001/2026-S1C-ND-CC)\n\n| Week | Assessment                                | Weight  | Type       |\n|------|-------------------------------------------|---------|------------|\n| 3    | Early Feedback Task                       | 1%      | Individual |\n| 5    | Project 1: Describing data                | 10%     | Individual |\n| 10   | Project 2: Analysing experimental data    | 20%     | Individual |\n| 13   | Project 3: Presentation (multivariate)    | 20%     | Group      |\n| -    | Quizzes (weekly, multiple due dates)      | 4%      | Individual |\n| -    | Exam (2 hours, MCQs + Short Answers)      | 45%     | Individual |\n\n\n# South Eveleigh Precinct\nUsed to be known as the **Australian Technology Park** (ATP). *Still is, but it used to, too.*\n\n## Biomedical Building\n![Credit: Michael Wheatland](images/biomedical.jpg)\n\n\n## Directions\n\n### Buses\n[Courtesy buses][buses] are available:\n\n- The best option is to take the bus from **Fisher Library** to **Redfern Station**, then walk to the precinct (through the new station platform as “local traffic”).\n- Alternatively, direct buses are available -- but less frequent.\n\n### Driving\nFree parking is available around Henderson Road, but it is extremely crowded. We do *not* recommend driving to the precinct.\n\n## Walking\nWalking to the South Eveleigh Precinct takes about 20 minutes. However, you can save approximately 5 minutes by using Redfern station's community access gates, where you don't need to use an Opal card to get through.\n\n[If the map does not load, click here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vs6aXA6YY4cL98Po7)\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m28!1m12!1m3!1d3311.892510223299!2d151.19220377714373!3d-33.89242207028511!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m13!3e2!4m5!1s0x6b12b1d46683b08b%3A0x16d4584b9e392df3!2sCarslaw%20Building%2C%20University%20of%20Sydney%2C%20Camperdown%20NSW%2C%20Australia!3m2!1d-33.8885751!2d151.1903621!4m5!1s0x6b12b1ce3cfcd14d%3A0xe363fbe9239512d6!2s1%20Central%20Avenue%2C%20Eveleigh%20NSW%2C%20Australia!3m2!1d-33.896277999999995!2d151.19577999999998!5e0!3m2!1sen!2smy!4v1702530988987!5m2!1sen!2smy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"450\" style=\"border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\"></iframe>\n\n# Your Statistical journey\n\n\n\n## Does migration come at a cost?\n\nIn a partially migratory elk population in Alberta, Canada, researchers compared calf birth weights between resident and migrant herds.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lecture-01a_files/figure-revealjs/elk-birthweight-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*You'll learn to compare groups like this with **t-tests** (Weeks 1--3).*\n\n## Can crop rotation restore soil health?\n\nA greenhouse experiment tested how soil conditioned by different crops affects the growth of subsequent plantings.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lecture-01a_files/figure-revealjs/crop-rotation-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*You'll learn to compare multiple treatments with **ANOVA** (Weeks 3--6).*\n\n## How are plants adapting to drought?\n\nCapeweed populations collected across a natural aridity gradient in southern Australia were grown under controlled conditions to test whether plants from drier areas had evolved drought-resistant traits.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lecture-01a_files/figure-revealjs/plant-aridity-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*You'll learn to model relationships like this with **regression** (Weeks 7--9).*\n\n## Darwin's finches: evolution you can measure\n\nPeter and Rosemary Grant spent 40 years measuring beak morphology in Galápagos finches, documenting natural selection in real time.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lecture-01a_files/figure-revealjs/darwin-finches-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*You'll learn to find patterns in complex datasets with **multivariate methods** (Weeks 10--12).*\n\n\n\n# Doing well\n\n\n## Lecture attendance options\n### In-person vs. online recordings\n\n::: fragment\n**In-person benefits:**\n\n- Real-time interaction with peers and lecturers\n- Immediate feedback and clarification of concepts\n- Active participation in discussions and polls\n- Building connections with classmates\n\n**Online recording benefits:**\n\n- Flexibility to manage other commitments\n- Ability to pause and review complex concepts\n- Learn at your own pace\n- Convenient for those with long commutes\n:::\n\n## On-campus or online?\n\nChoose the option that best suits your learning style and circumstances. **If watching online, try to**:\n\n- Stay up to date with recordings to avoid falling behind\n- Use Ed discussion board actively for questions\n- **Attend some lectures in person when possible for key topics**\n\nThere is a strong positive correlation between lecture attendance and final grades -- but it's not the only factor. *It may just be the case that students who attend lectures are more likely to keep up with the course material.*\n\n## Put in the hours \n- This is a **6 credit point** unit, which means that you are expected to spend **120 -- 150 hours** in total, including exam prep time (~10 h per week)!\n- **Practice makes perfect**. Tutorials and Labs help you apply the concepts you learn in lectures -- complete all the exercises, and practice with the bonus questions provided.\n\n![](images/adventuretime.gif){fig-align=\"center\" height=350}\n\n## Ask questions\n\n- [**Ed**][edsite] is the *best* place to ask questions. We are way more responsive on **Ed** than on email.\n- We are *open* to the use of AI tools (including LLMs like ChatGPT) to help you answer questions about code... but don't use them to cheat *yourself* out of learning.\n- We have **drop-in sessions**, where you can jump in and have a chat on Zoom. We will announce the schedule on **Ed**.\n\n# Learning outcomes\n\n## By the end of this course, we want you to be able to:\n- **LO1** demonstrate proficiency in designing sample schemes and analysing data from them **using R**.\n- **LO2** describe and identify the basic features of an **experimental design**: replicate, treatment structure and blocking structure.\n- **LO3** demonstrate proficiency in the use or the statistical programming language **R** to apply an ANOVA and fit regression models to experimental data.\n- **LO4** demonstrate proficiency in the use or the statistical programming language **R** to use multivariate methods to find patterns in data.\n- **LO5** interpret the output and understand conceptually how its derived of a regression, ANOVA and multivariate analysis that have been calculated by R.\n- **LO6** write statistical and modelling results as part of a scientific report.\n- **LO7** appraise the validity of statistical analyses used publications.\n\n\n# Thanks for listening!
