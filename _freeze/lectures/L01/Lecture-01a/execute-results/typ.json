You  must then walk to the precint (10 minutes).\n\n\n### Driving\nFree parking is available around Henderson Road, but it is extremely crowded. We do *not* recommend driving to the precinct.\n\n### Walking\nWalking to the South Eveleigh Precinct takes about 20 minutes from Carslaw. You can save approximately 5 minutes by using Redfern station's community access gates.\n\n\n# Expectations\n\n## Attendance\n\n### Lectures are compulsory, but not a hurdle\n\n- You are expected to attend 80% of lectures, and attendance is recorded via Ed Discussion Boards\n- Attendance is **not** a hurdle. We use attendance data to determine if students are engaging with the course\n\n### Labs are compulsory with 80% minimum attendance\n\n- Labs are the heart of this unit. No exceptions except through special consideration\n- We will not record your attendance if you are not present for more than 50% of the lab session (we round things up)\n\n\n## Assessments\n\nCheck [Unit Outline](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/ENVX2001/2026-S1C-ND-CC)\n\n| Week | Assessment                                | Weight  | Type       |\n|------|-------------------------------------------|---------|------------|\n| 3    | Early Feedback Task                       | 1%      | Individual |\n| 5    | Project 1: Describing data                | 10%     | Individual |\n| 10   | Project 2: Analysing experimental data    | 20%     | Individual |\n| 13   | Project 3: Presentation (multivariate)    | 20%     | Group      |\n| -    | Quizzes (weekly, multiple due dates)      | 4%      | Individual |\n| -    | Exam (2 hours, MCQs + Short Answers)      | 45%     | Individual |\n\n\n# Doing well\n\n## Put in the hours \n- This is a **6 credit point** unit, which means that you are expected to spend **120 -- 150 hours** in total, including exam prep time (~10 h per week)!\n- **Practice makes perfect**. Tutorials and Labs help you apply the concepts you learn in lectures -- complete all the exercises, and practice with the bonus questions provided.\n\n![](images/adventuretime.gif){fig-align=\"center\" height=350}\n\n## Ask questions\n\nDon't be afraid to seek help. We are happy when students show genuine interest to learn and will do our best to support you. Here are some ways to ask questions:\n\n- [**Ed Discussion**][edsite] is the *best* place to ask questions. We are way more responsive on **Ed** than on email.\n- **Drop-in sessions** are available. Check Ed Discussion for times and links.\n\n# Learning outcomes\n\n## By the end of this course, we want you to be able to:\n- **LO1** demonstrate proficiency in designing sample schemes and analysing data from them **using R**.\n- **LO2** describe and identify the basic features of an **experimental design**: replicate, treatment structure and blocking structure.\n- **LO3** demonstrate proficiency in the use or the statistical programming language **R** to apply an ANOVA and fit regression models to experimental data.\n- **LO4** demonstrate proficiency in the use or the statistical programming language **R** to use multivariate methods to find patterns in data.\n- **LO5** interpret the output and understand conceptually how its derived of a regression, ANOVA and multivariate analysis that have been calculated by R.\n- **LO6** write statistical and modelling results as part of a scientific report.\n- **LO7** appraise the validity of statistical analyses used publications.\n\n\n# Questions?\n\n\n\nThis presentation is based on the [SOLES Quarto reveal.js template](https://github.com/usyd-soles-edu/soles-revealjs) and is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License][cc-by] \n\n\n## Take a break \n\nWe will resume the second half of the lecture in 10 minutes.
