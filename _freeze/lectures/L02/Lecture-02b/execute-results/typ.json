Each stratum is sampled, so the sample is representative of the population.\n- **Accuracy**. Each stratum is represented by a minimum number of sampling units.\n- **Insight**. We can compare strata and make inferences about the population.\n\n:::fragment\n### Does this make simple random sampling obsolete?\n\n- **No**. *Still* a good technique.\n- With large enough samples, the two methods will converge.\n- Chance of *not* selecting a unit from a stratum is always there, but reduces as the sample size increases.\n\n:::\n\n# Stratified random sampling: estimates\n\n## What are we trying to achieve with our calculations?\n\n### The statistical journey\n\n::: fragment\nOnce we have our stratified sample, we need to:\n\n1. **Estimate the population central tendency**: Calculate the pooled mean\n2. **Quantify our uncertainty**: Calculate the pooled standard error\n3. **Create an inference tool**: Build a confidence interval\n4. **Make decisions**: Compare estimates, test hypotheses\n\nAll of these steps must account for our stratified design.\n:::\n\n\n## The statistical workflow for stratified sampling\n\n### Four key steps:\n\n1. **Pooled Mean ($\\bar{y}_{s}$)**: Sum of (stratum weight × stratum mean)\n   - Best estimate of the population parameter\n\n2. **Pooled Standard Error**: $$SE(\\bar{y}_{s}) = \\sqrt{\\sum w_i^2 \\times \\frac{s_i^2}{n_i}}$$\n   - Accounts for stratum weights and within-stratum variability\n\n3. **t-Critical Value**: Based on $df = n - L$ and α = 0.05\n   - Accounts for sample size in uncertainty estimates\n\n4. **Confidence Interval**: $$\\text{Pooled mean} \\pm (t-\\text{critical} \\times SE(\\bar{y}_{s}))$$\n   - Range likely containing true population mean\n\n\n## Accounting for strata using \"weight\"\n\n### Weighted estimates\n\n- We need to \"weigh\" the estimates from each stratum to account for the different stratum sizes and inclusion probabilities.\n- Most of the time, we use the stratum size as the weight to calculate **weighted estimates**.\n- The *overall* population estimate is the sum of the weighted estimates from each stratum, i.e. we *pool the individual strata information into a single, overall population estimate*.\n\n::: fragment\n### Example\n::: incremental\n\n- A forest contains two types of trees: A and B, with 60% and 40% of the population, respectively.\n- We want to estimate the **mean height** of the trees.\n- Take **10** height measurements, of which 7 are randomly selected from type A and 3 are randomly selected from type B.\n- The **pooled estimate** for the *mean height* of the trees is: $$0.6 \\times \\text{average height of A} + 0.4 \\times \\text{average height of B}$$\n:::\n:::\n\n# Data story: soil carbon\n\n## Soil carbon data\n\n### Our case study\n\nSoil carbon content was measured at 7 locations across the area.

Return to the **same sites**?\n  2. Select completely **new sites**?\n- This choice affects our statistical analysis (covariance)\n:::\n\n\n## Monitoring estimates\n\n### Change in mean $\\Delta \\bar y$\n\n> The difference between the means of the two sets of measurements.\n\n$$\\Delta \\bar y = \\bar y_2 - \\bar y_1$$\n\nwhere $\\bar y_2$ and $\\bar y_1$ are the means of the second and first set of measurements, respectively.\n\n## Uncertainty in change estimates\n\n::: fragment\n### Variance *of the change in mean* $Var(\\Delta{\\bar y})$\n\nThis tells us how precise our estimate of the change is.
