Create an RStudio Project.\n2. Create a Quarto document and customise it.\n3. Format text and explore some advanced Quarto options.\n\n## Getting started\n\n::: column-margin\nIn some instances you will see notes like this one in the margin, which often contain useful tips or reminders.\n:::\n\n- These tutorials are designed to be comprehensive yet accessible. I recommend following along and completing the exercises as you go. \n- You will need to **create your own Quarto document** to complete the exercises. In RStudio, go to \n  - `File -> New File -> Quarto Document...` or \n  - `File -> New File -> R Markdown...` and follow the intuitive prompts.\n- If you have any suggestions for improvement, please let me know! Send me an email (you can find my details on Canvas).\n\n# RStudio Projects\n\nRStudio Projects help you keep your work organised and reproducible. While not strictly necessary, they make your life easier, especially when working on multiple project.\n\n\n## Why Use Projects?\n\nRStudio Projects help with organisation by keeping all project files together in one directory. They also ensure reproducibility by making your code work consistently across different computers. Think of them as a way to \"tell\" RStudio that all your work for a particular project is in one place.\n\nAt its heart, **an RStudio Project is simply a text file with the `.Rproj` extension.** This file lives in your folder that you're working in, and tells RStudio to treat that folder as a project. Once created, RStudio manages the project for you and you never have to edit the `.Rproj` file directly.\n\n\n## Setting up a Project\n\nLet's set up a new project for ENVX2001 in RStudio.\n\n1. Open RStudio\n2. Click **File -> New Project...**\n3. Select either **New Directory** or **Existing Directory**\n   - **New Directory** creates a new folder for your project\n   - **Existing Directory** lets you choose a folder that already exists\n4. Select **New Project** unless you have a specific project you want to work on (e.g. a Quarto Blog)\n5. Name your project \"ENVX2001\" or similar, choose where to save it, and click **Create Project**. You will see other options, but you can ignore them for now.\n\n::: column-margin\nGive your project a meaningful name, ideally with \"ENVX2001\" in it so you can identify it later. For example \"ENVX2001 Labs\".\n:::\n\n## Recommended folder structure\n\nModern technology means that some of you may never have to touch the file system. However, it's still good to know how to organise your files. Search the internet for using the Finder (macOS) or the File Explorer (Windows) if you need a refresher.\n\n Here's a recommended folder structure for your project:\n\n```plaintext\nENVX2001/\n├── labs/\n│   ├── data/\n│   ├── Lab01.qmd\n│   ├── Lab02.qmd\n│   ├── ...\n│   └── ENVX2001-labs.Rproj\n├── project_1/\n│   ├── data/\n│   ├── project1.qmd\n│   └── ENVX2001-labs.Rproj\n├── project_2/\n│   ├── data/\n│   └── ...\n└── ...\n```\n\n## Opening Projects\n\n### From File Explorer (PC) or Finder (Mac)\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to your project folder\n2. Double-click the `.Rproj` file\n   - On Windows: Look for the RStudio cube icon\n   - On Mac: Look for the `.Rproj` extension\n\n### From Within RStudio\n\n#### Manually:\n1. Click `File -> Open Project...`\n2. Navigate to your project folder\n3. Select the `.Rproj` file\n4. Click \"Open\"\n\n#### Recent projects:\nIf you've opened the project before, your project may already be open! Check the top-right corner of RStudio -- if you see your project name, you're good to go. Click on the dropdown to switch to recently opened projects.\n\n## Benefits\n\nWhen in a project, RStudio will remember your working directory, history, and environment. This means you can close RStudio and come back to your project later, and everything will be as you left it. This is especially useful when working on a project over multiple days. Additionally, adding data files to your project folder will make them easier to access in your code as you can use **relative paths**. For example, instead of using:\n\n```r\nread.csv(\"C:/Users/username/Documents/ENVX2001/data.csv\")\n``` \n\nyou can use:\n\n```r\nread.csv(\"data/data.csv\")\n```\n\nThe latter is more portable and **will work on any computer**, as long as the data file is in the `data` folder, while the former will only work on your computer as it would have your user name on it!\n\n## What's next?\n\nSet up an RStudio project separately for your labs and projects. This will make it easier to keep your work organised and reproducible. Otherwise, there isn't much else to think about as RStudio will manage the project for you. Just remember to open your project when you start working on it!\n\n---\n\n# Quarto \n\n## Getting Started\n\nLet's create and modify a Quarto document about The Beatles. Follow these steps to learn about Quarto's features:\n\n1. In RStudio, go to **File > New File > Quarto Document...**\n2. In the dialogue box that appears:\n   - Enter \"The Beatles: A Musical Journey\" as the title\n   - Add your name as the author\n   - Select \"HTML\" as the output format\n3. Click \"Create\"\n\n## Exercise 1: Setting Up Your Document\n\n1. Delete all the example content in your new document (but keep the YAML header)\n2. Replace your YAML header with this enhanced version:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"The Beatles: A Musical Journey\"\nsubtitle: \"From Liverpool to Global Stardom\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ndate: \"today\"\nformat: \n  html:\n    toc: true\n    number-sections: true\n    theme: cosmo\n---\n```\n\n3. Click \"Render\" to see what an empty document looks like\n\n## Exercise 2: Adding Content\n\nCopy and paste this text after your YAML header:\n\n```markdown\n## The Early Years\n\nThe Beatles' story begins in Liverpool, England, where John Lennon formed a band called the Quarrymen in 1957. Paul McCartney joined soon after, followed by George Harrison in 1958. The band went through several name changes before settling on \"The Beatles\" in 1960.\n\n## Hamburg and The Cavern Club\n\n### The Hamburg Experience\n\nIn 1960, the Beatles began playing in Hamburg, Germany. These extended performances helped them develop their stage presence and musical style. During this period, they recruited Ringo Starr as their drummer, completing the lineup that would become legendary.\n\n### The Cavern Club Era\n\nBack in Liverpool, the Beatles became regular performers at The Cavern Club. Between 1961 and 1963, they performed there 292 times. The club became synonymous with their early success and the birth of the \"Merseybeat\" sound.\n\n## Global Phenomenon\n\nBy 1964, \"Beatlemania\" had taken hold worldwide. Their appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in February 1964 was watched by an estimated 73 million viewers. This marked the beginning of the \"British Invasion\" and revolutionised popular music.\n\n## Musical Evolution\n\nThe Beatles continuously evolved their musical style throughout their career:\n\n1. Early rock and roll (1962-1964)\n2. Folk rock period (1965-1966)\n3. Psychedelic era (1966-1968)\n4. Return to roots (1969-1970)\n\nTheir willingness to experiment with different musical styles and recording techniques set new standards for popular music.\n```\n\n3. Click \"Render\" again to see the formatted document\n\n## Exercise 3: Experimenting with YAML Options\n\nTry these modifications to your YAML header one at a time, rendering after each change:\n\n1. Change the theme:\n```yaml\ntheme: darkly  # Try: flatly, journal, darkly\n```\n\n2. Add a table of contents:\n```yaml\ntoc: true\n```\n\n3. Add section numbers:\n```yaml\nnumber-sections: true\n```\n\n4. Try them all together:\n```yaml\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    theme: cosmo\n    number-sections: true\n```\n\n## Exercise 4: Try Different Output Formats\n\n### Microsoft Word\nTry creating a Word document by changing your YAML to:\n```yaml\nformat:\n  docx:\n    toc: true\n    number-sections: true\n```\n\nYou can learn more about Word output options in the [Quarto Word documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html).\n\n### Typst (Advanced Option)\nTypst is a modern alternative to LaTeX/PDF, but it requires some learning to customise effectively. If you're interested in exploring it:\n\n```yaml\nformat:\n  typst:\n    toc: true\n```\n\nLearn more about Typst in:\n- [Quarto's Typst documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/typst.html)\n- [Official Typst documentation](https://typst.app/docs)\n\n### Multiple Output Formats\nYou can create multiple output formats simultaneously by specifying them in your YAML header:\n\n\n```yaml\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    number-sections: true\n    theme: cosmo\n  docx:\n    toc: true\n    number-sections: true\n```\n\nEach format can have its own specific options. For example, you could have different themes for HTML while maintaining consistent structure across all formats.\n\n## Quick Tips\n\n1. Use keyboard shortcut to render: \n   - Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+K \n   - Mac: Cmd+Shift+K\n2. Preview different themes from the complete list [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html)\n3. Keep experimenting with different YAML options to see what works best for your documents\n\n# Writing in Quarto\n\nLet's jump right into it. Create a new Quarto document for this tutorial, and remove the template content except for the YAML header. \n\n## Exercise 1: Markdown\n\nFirst, let's practice some basic markdown formatting.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Replicate this\n\nHere's a brief overview of **Christopher Nolan's** filmmaking:\n\n1. His film *Inception* (2010) took **ten years** to write\n2. He wrote _Memento_ based on **two key concepts**:\n   - *Anterograde amnesia*\n   - _Non-linear storytelling_\n3. His highest-grossing film is *The Dark Knigh Rises* (2012), which earned over **$1 billion** worldwide.\n\nHis signature style: complex narratives with time manipulation as seen in *Interstellar* and _Tenet_.\n\nVisit [IMDB's Nolan Page](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/) for his complete filmography.\n:::\n\nTry to replicate the text and formatting above, including the link to IMDB, in your own document, using markdown syntax. For reference, check out the [Quarto Markdown Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).\n\n## Exercise 2: Working with code chunks\n\nNow let's focus on code. We will work with data from the `palmerpenguins` package to visualise and summarise some data. Try running the following code chunks in your document:\n````\n```{{r}}\n#| label: setup\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n```\n````\n\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\nNever run package installation code (`install.packages()`) in your Quarto document! Instead, install required packages in the R console:\n\n```r\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"palmerpenguins\"))\n```\n\nThis ensures your document remains reproducible and prevents installation errors during rendering.\n:::\n\nLet's break down the chunk options:\n\n- `label:` gives your chunk a unique name\n- `message: false` suppresses package loading messages\n- `warning: false` suppresses warnings\n- The `#|` syntax makes options more readable\n\n## Exercise 3: Creating Visualizations\n\nNow let's create some plots with carefully controlled output:\n\n````\n```{{r}}\n#| label: penguin-plot\n#| fig-cap: \"Penguin body mass by species\"\n#| fig-width: 8\n#| fig-height: 6\n#| fig-align: center\n#| echo: true\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(species, body_mass_g, fill = species)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(y = \"Body Mass (g)\",\n       x = \"Species\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n````\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Penguin body mass by species](tutorial01_files/figure-typst/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNew options to notice:\n\n- `fig-width` and `fig-height` control plot dimensions\n- `fig-align` centers the plot\n- `echo: true` shows the code (try changing to `false`)\n\n## Exercise 4: Tables and data\n\nLet's explore different ways to display data:\n\n````\n```{{r}}\n#| label: penguin-summary\n#| tbl-cap: \"Summary Statistics by Species\"\n\npenguins %>%\n  group_by(species) %>%\n  summarise(\n    mean_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),\n    sd_mass = sd(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n = n()\n  ) %>%\n  knitr::kable()\n```\n````\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='Summary Statistics by Species'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|species   | mean_mass|  sd_mass|   n|\n|:---------|---------:|--------:|---:|\n|Adelie    |  3700.662| 458.5661| 152|\n|Chinstrap |  3733.088| 384.3351|  68|\n|Gentoo    |  5076.016| 504.1162| 124|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 5: Interactive features\n\nQuarto excels at creating interactive content. Try this:\n\n````\n```{{r}}\n#| label: interactive-plot\n#| warning: false\n\nlibrary(plotly)\np <- ggplot(penguins, \n            aes(flipper_length_mm, \n                body_mass_g, \n                color = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(p)\n```\n````\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tutorial01_files/figure-typst/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd for interactive tables:\n\n````\n```{{r}}\n#| label: interactive-table\n\nlibrary(DT)\ndatatable(penguins)\n```\n````\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](tutorial01_files/figure-typst/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 6: Useful chunk options\n\nHere are some useful chunk options, try them:\n\n1. Cache computations (great for slow calculations):\n````\n```{{r}}\n#| label: slow-calculation\n#| cache: true\n\n# Your time-consuming code here\nSys.sleep(2)  # Simulating slow computation\n```\n````\n\n2. Run code but hide everything:\n````\n```{{r}}\n#| label: hidden-setup\n#| include: false\n\n# This code runs but shows nothing\ntheme_set(theme_minimal())\n```\n````\n\n3. Show code but don't run it:\n````\n```{{r}}\n#| label: example-code\n#| eval: false\n\n# This code is displayed but not executed\nggplot(data) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n````\nTry changing the values for options like `echo`, `include`, and others from `true` to `false` (or vice versa). See what happens.\n\n## Quick tips\n\n1. Use meaningful chunk labels - they help with debugging\n2. Keep chunks focused on single tasks\n3. Cache slow computations with `cache: true`\n4. Use `include: false` for setup code you don't want to show\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThat's it! Well done. The [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/) is a great resource for more advanced features, but beware -- it's a rabbit hole...\n\n# Done!\n\n### Thanks! {-}\n\nThis is the end of the tutorial. \n\n::: column-margin\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, let me know during the lectures or via email.
