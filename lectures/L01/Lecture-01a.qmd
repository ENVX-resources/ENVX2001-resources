# Your statistical journey

```{r}
#| label: setup-journey
#| include: false
library(ggplot2)
```

## Does migration come at a cost?

In a partially migratory elk population in Alberta, Canada, researchers compared calf birth weights between resident and migrant herds.

```{r}
#| label: elk-birthweight
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
elk <- read.csv("data/elk_calf_clean.csv")
elk$mig_status <- factor(elk$mig_status,
  levels = c("Resident", "Eastern"),
  labels = c("Resident", "Migrant")
)

ggplot(elk, aes(x = mig_status, y = birth_wt, fill = mig_status)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(end = 0.9) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Birth weight (kg)") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18)
```

*You have already learnt to compare groups like this with **t-tests** (Weeks 1--3).*

## Can dogs smell human stress?

Eighteen pet dogs were exposed to odours from humans who were either relaxed or stressed. Researchers then measured how long each dog took to approach food bowls.

```{r}
#| label: dog-odour
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
dogs <- read.csv("data/dog_odour_clean.csv")
dogs$treatment <- factor(dogs$treatment,
  levels = c("Baseline", "Relaxed", "Stressed")
)

dog_means <- aggregate(latency ~ dog_id + treatment, data = dogs, FUN = mean)

ggplot(dog_means, aes(x = treatment, y = latency, fill = treatment)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(end = 0.9) +
  labs(x = "Odour treatment", y = "Mean latency (s)") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

What if there are more than 2 groups to compare? We use **Analysis of Variances (ANOVA)** (Weeks 3--6).

## How big is that penguin?

Heavier penguins tend to have longer flippers -- but how strong is that relationship?

```{r}
#| label: penguin-regression
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = species), alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", aes(linetype = "Linear")) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), aes(linetype = "Quadratic")) +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(end = 0.9) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)", linetype = "Model") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18)
```

We can model this relationship with **regression**, but how do we validate this against other models? You will learn to do this with **model selection** (Weeks 7--9).

## Hawks of Iowa
Researchers at Lake MacBride, Iowa trapped three hawk species over a decade and measured wing length, weight, culmen, and hallux on each bird.

```{r}
#| label: hawks-pca
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
hawks <- read.csv("data/hawks_clean.csv")
pca <- prcomp(hawks[, c("Wing", "Weight", "Culmen", "Hallux")], scale. = TRUE)
scores <- data.frame(pca$x, Species = hawks$Species)

ggplot(scores, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, colour = Species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  stat_ellipse(linewidth = 1) +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(end = 0.9) +
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", colour = "Species") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18)
```

We can represent multivariate data in fewer dimensions using **multivariate methods** (Weeks 10--12).

## Transport options

### Buses
[Courtesy buses][buses] are available from **Fisher Library** to **Redfern Station**. You  must then walk to the precint (10 minutes).


### Driving
Free parking is available around Henderson Road, but it is extremely crowded. We do *not* recommend driving to the precinct.

### Walking
Walking to the South Eveleigh Precinct takes about 20 minutes from Carslaw. You can save approximately 5 minutes by using Redfern station's community access gates.


# Expectations

# Doing well

## Put in the hours 
- This is a **6 credit point** unit, which means that you are expected to spend **120 -- 150 hours** in total, including exam prep time (~10 h per week)!
- **Practice makes perfect**. Tutorials and Labs help you apply the concepts you learn in lectures -- complete all the exercises, and practice with the bonus questions provided.

## Ask questions

Don't be afraid to seek help. We are happy when students show genuine interest to learn and will do our best to support you. Here are some ways to ask questions:

- [**Ed Discussion**][edsite] is the *best* place to ask questions. We are way more responsive on **Ed** than on email.
- **Drop-in sessions** are available. Check Ed Discussion for times and links.

# Learning outcomes

## By the end of this course, we want you to be able to:
- **LO1** demonstrate proficiency in designing sample schemes and analysing data from them **using R**.
- **LO2** describe and identify the basic features of an **experimental design**: replicate, treatment structure and blocking structure.
- **LO3** demonstrate proficiency in the use or the statistical programming language **R** to apply an ANOVA and fit regression models to experimental data.
- **LO4** demonstrate proficiency in the use or the statistical programming language **R** to use multivariate methods to find patterns in data.
- **LO5** interpret the output and understand conceptually how its derived of a regression, ANOVA and multivariate analysis that have been calculated by R.
- **LO6** write statistical and modelling results as part of a scientific report.
- **LO7** appraise the validity of statistical analyses used publications.
