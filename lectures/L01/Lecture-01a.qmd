## Structure

This unit includes lectures, self-guided tutorials, labs, discussions, and drop-in sessions.

- **Lectures**: Tuesdays 10 AM, Wednesdays 11 AM, [Chemistry Lecture Theatre 3][clt03]
- **Tutorials**: Self-guided (1 hour), complete before each week's lab.
- **Labs**: South Eveleigh Precinct, Thursday 9 am – 12 pm, Friday 10 am – 1 pm, 2 pm – 5 pm
- **Discussion**: Via Ed discussion, we usually respond the same day unless it is the weekend.
- **Drop-in sessions**: Scheduled as necessary (Zoom or in person). Email us to arrange a session.

## Attendance

1. **Lectures**: Highly recommended but not compulsory. Lectures are recorded, capturing slides and audio only, which may miss important discussions.
2. **Labs**: Mandatory, 80% minimum attendance required. Attendance will be taken by QR code. If you miss a lab, you may attend another session that week -- send us an email!
3. **Tutorials**: Self-guided (1 hour), complete before each week's lab.

# South Eveleigh Precinct
Used to be known as the **Australian Technology Park** (ATP). *Still is, but it used to, too.*

## Directions

### Buses
[Courtesy buses][buses] are available:

- The best option is to take the bus from **Fisher Library** to **Redfern Station**, then walk to the precinct (through the new station platform as “local traffic”).
- Alternatively, direct buses are available -- but less frequent.

### Driving
Free parking is available around Henderson Road, but it is extremely crowded. We do *not* recommend driving to the precinct.

## Walking
Walking to the South Eveleigh Precinct takes about 20 minutes. However, you can save approximately 5 minutes by using Redfern station's community access gates, where you don't need to use an Opal card to get through.

# Your Statistical Journey

## Statistics in Action

Modern science and decision-making are driven by data:

::: {.fragment}
- **Research**: From lab experiments to field studies
- **Policy**: Environmental management decisions
- **Industry**: Business analytics and optimisation
- **Innovation**: AI and machine learning -- foundations
:::

## Why Statistics Matters?

Statistics empowers you to:

::: {.fragment}
- Turn raw data into meaningful insights
- Make evidence-based decisions
- Communicate findings effectively
- Solve complex real-world problems

# Doing well


## Lecture attendance options
### In-person vs. online recordings

::: fragment
**In-person benefits:**

- Real-time interaction with peers and lecturers
- Immediate feedback and clarification of concepts
- Active participation in discussions and polls
- Building connections with classmates

**Online recording benefits:**

- Flexibility to manage other commitments
- Ability to pause and review complex concepts
- Learn at your own pace
- Convenient for those with long commutes
:::

## On-campus or online?

Choose the option that best suits your learning style and circumstances. **If watching online, try to**:

- Stay up to date with recordings to avoid falling behind
- Use Ed discussion board actively for questions
- **Attend some lectures in person when possible for key topics**

There is a strong positive correlation between lecture attendance and final grades -- but it's not the only factor. *It may just be the case that students who attend lectures are more likely to keep up with the course material.*

## Put in the hours 
- This is a **6 credit point** unit, which means that you are expected to spend **120 -- 150 hours** in total, including exam prep time (~10 h per week)!
- **Practice makes perfect**. Tutorials and Labs help you apply the concepts you learn in lectures -- complete all the exercises, and practice with the bonus questions provided.

## Ask questions

- [**Ed**][edsite] is the *best* place to ask questions. We are way more responsive on **Ed** than on email.
- We are *open* to the use of AI tools (including LLMs like ChatGPT) to help you answer questions about code... but don't use them to cheat *yourself* out of learning.
- We have **drop-in sessions**, where you can jump in and have a chat on Zoom. We will announce the schedule on **Ed**.

# Learning outcomes

## By the end of this course, we want you to be able to:
- **LO1** demonstrate proficiency in designing sample schemes and analysing data from them **using R**.
- **LO2** describe and identify the basic features of an **experimental design**: replicate, treatment structure and blocking structure.
- **LO3** demonstrate proficiency in the use or the statistical programming language **R** to apply an ANOVA and fit regression models to experimental data.
- **LO4** demonstrate proficiency in the use or the statistical programming language **R** to use multivariate methods to find patterns in data.
- **LO5** interpret the output and understand conceptually how its derived of a regression, ANOVA and multivariate analysis that have been calculated by R.
- **LO6** write statistical and modelling results as part of a scientific report.
- **LO7** appraise the validity of statistical analyses used publications.
