## Structure


### Scheduled sessions

- Lectures run **Wednesdays 10 am–12 pm** in [Chemistry Lecture Theatre 3][clt03].
- Labs are held at the **South Eveleigh Precinct** — Thursdays 9 am–12 pm, Fridays 10 am–1 pm or 2–5 pm.

### Getting help

- Ed Discussion board - best place for discussion and announcements
- Emails - for private matters
- Drop-in sessions - arrange with me (Januar) if you want to have a chat on Zoom


## Attendance

1. **Lectures**: Compulsory, but **not** a hurdle. If you choose to watch the recordings, understand that academic decisions (e.g. review of exams) will be made based on your attendance records for lectures and labs.
2. **Labs**: Mandatory, 80% minimum attendance required. Attendance will be taken by QR code. If you miss a lab, you may attend another session that week -- send us an email!
3. **Tutorials**: Self-guided (1 hour), complete before each week's lab.

# South Eveleigh Precinct
Used to be known as the **Australian Technology Park** (ATP). *Still is, but it used to, too.*

## Directions

### Buses
[Courtesy buses][buses] are available:

- The best option is to take the bus from **Fisher Library** to **Redfern Station**, then walk to the precinct (through the new station platform as “local traffic”).
- Alternatively, direct buses are available -- but less frequent.

### Driving
Free parking is available around Henderson Road, but it is extremely crowded. We do *not* recommend driving to the precinct.

## Walking
Walking to the South Eveleigh Precinct takes about 20 minutes. However, you can save approximately 5 minutes by using Redfern station's community access gates, where you don't need to use an Opal card to get through.

# Your Statistical journey

```{r}
#| label: setup-journey
#| include: false
library(ggplot2)
```

## Does migration come at a cost?

In a partially migratory elk population in Alberta, Canada, researchers compared calf birth weights between resident and migrant herds.

```{r}
#| label: elk-birthweight
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
elk <- read.csv("data/elk_calf_clean.csv")
elk$mig_status <- factor(elk$mig_status,
  levels = c("Resident", "Eastern"),
  labels = c("Resident", "Migrant")
)

ggplot(elk, aes(x = mig_status, y = birth_wt, fill = mig_status)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(end = 0.9) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Birth weight (kg)") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18)
```

*You'll learn to compare groups like this with **t-tests** (Weeks 1--3).*

## Can dogs smell human stress?

Eighteen pet dogs were exposed to odours from humans who were either relaxed or stressed. Researchers then measured how long each dog took to approach food bowls, looking for signs of anxiety.

```{r}
#| label: dog-odour
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
dogs <- read.csv("data/dog_odour_clean.csv")
dogs$treatment <- factor(dogs$treatment,
  levels = c("Baseline", "Relaxed", "Stressed")
)

dog_means <- aggregate(latency ~ dog_id + treatment, data = dogs, FUN = mean)

ggplot(dog_means, aes(x = treatment, y = latency, colour = treatment)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "crossbar", width = 0.5,
    linewidth = 0.8, colour = "black") +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(end = 0.9) +
  labs(x = "Odour treatment", y = "Mean latency (s)") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

*You'll learn to compare multiple treatments with **ANOVA** (Weeks 3--6).*

## How big is that penguin?

Researchers at Palmer Station, Antarctica measured body dimensions of three penguin species over three years. Heavier penguins tend to have longer flippers -- but how strong is that relationship?

```{r}
#| label: penguin-regression
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = species), alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(end = 0.9) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18)
```

*You'll learn to model relationships like this with **regression** (Weeks 7--9).*

## Darwin's finches: evolution you can measure

Peter and Rosemary Grant spent 40 years measuring beak morphology in Galápagos finches, documenting natural selection in real time.

```{r}
#| label: darwin-finches
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
finches <- read.csv("data/darwin_finches_clean.csv")

ggplot(finches, aes(x = beak_length, y = beak_depth, colour = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  stat_ellipse(linewidth = 1) +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(end = 0.9) +
  labs(x = "Beak length (mm)", y = "Beak depth (mm)", colour = "Species") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18)
```

*You'll learn to find patterns in complex datasets with **multivariate methods** (Weeks 10--12).*



# Doing well


## Lecture attendance options
### In-person vs. online recordings

::: fragment
**In-person benefits:**

- Real-time interaction with peers and lecturers
- Immediate feedback and clarification of concepts
- Active participation in discussions and polls
- Building connections with classmates

**Online recording benefits:**

- Flexibility to manage other commitments
- Ability to pause and review complex concepts
- Learn at your own pace
- Convenient for those with long commutes
:::

## On-campus or online?

Choose the option that best suits your learning style and circumstances. **If watching online, try to**:

- Stay up to date with recordings to avoid falling behind
- Use Ed discussion board actively for questions
- **Attend some lectures in person when possible for key topics**

There is a strong positive correlation between lecture attendance and final grades -- but it's not the only factor. *It may just be the case that students who attend lectures are more likely to keep up with the course material.*

## Put in the hours 
- This is a **6 credit point** unit, which means that you are expected to spend **120 -- 150 hours** in total, including exam prep time (~10 h per week)!
- **Practice makes perfect**. Tutorials and Labs help you apply the concepts you learn in lectures -- complete all the exercises, and practice with the bonus questions provided.

## Ask questions

- [**Ed**][edsite] is the *best* place to ask questions. We are way more responsive on **Ed** than on email.
- We are *open* to the use of AI tools (including LLMs like ChatGPT) to help you answer questions about code... but don't use them to cheat *yourself* out of learning.
- We have **drop-in sessions**, where you can jump in and have a chat on Zoom. We will announce the schedule on **Ed**.

# Learning outcomes

## By the end of this course, we want you to be able to:
- **LO1** demonstrate proficiency in designing sample schemes and analysing data from them **using R**.
- **LO2** describe and identify the basic features of an **experimental design**: replicate, treatment structure and blocking structure.
- **LO3** demonstrate proficiency in the use or the statistical programming language **R** to apply an ANOVA and fit regression models to experimental data.
- **LO4** demonstrate proficiency in the use or the statistical programming language **R** to use multivariate methods to find patterns in data.
- **LO5** interpret the output and understand conceptually how its derived of a regression, ANOVA and multivariate analysis that have been calculated by R.
- **LO6** write statistical and modelling results as part of a scientific report.
- **LO7** appraise the validity of statistical analyses used publications.
