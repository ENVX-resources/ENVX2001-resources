# Last week

## Key concepts we covered

- **Population vs. sample**
  - Population: The complete set of all items we're studying
  - Sample: A subset of the population we actually measure

- **Parameters (population) and statistics (sample)**
  - Central tendency: how data clusters around a middle value
    - mean (average), median (middle value), mode (most common)
  - Spread/dispersion: how data points vary from each other
    - variance (average squared deviation), standard deviation (square root of variance)

- **Confidence intervals** -- we'll explore this further today!

We will focus on the fundamentals behind **observational studies** this week.

::: {.callout-tip}
**Mensurative** studies involve measuring without manipulating variables.  
**Absolute** studies measure actual values rather than comparing between treatments.
:::

## Observational studies: two common types
::: fragment
#### Surveys
- Estimate a statistic (e.g. mean, variance), but
- **no temporal change** during estimate.
- *E.g. measuring species richness in a forest*.
- *Think of it as a snapshot at one point in time.*
:::
::: fragment
#### Monitoring studies
- Estimate a ***change*** in statistic (same as above), and
- **temporal change** across observations, i.e. before and after.
- *E.g. measuring species richness in a forest **before and after a fire***.
- *Think of it as taking multiple snapshots over time to see changes.*
:::


## Sampling designs

::: fragment
### Simple random sampling:
- Each unit has an equal chance of being selected.
- **Randomly sample units from the entire population.**
- *Like putting all names in a hat and drawing some out randomly.*

![](images/simple_random.png){fig-align="center" height=140}
:::

::: fragment
### Stratified random sampling
- The population is first divided into *strata* (groups with similar characteristics).
- **Randomly sample units within each strata by simple random sampling.**
- *Like separating students by year level, then randomly selecting some from each year.*

![](images/stratified.png){fig-align="center" height=140}
:::



## What is "random" sampling?

::: fragment
***Random*** selection of **finite** or **infinite** population units.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
> What does *random* mean?
:::

::: fragment
Within a population, **all** units have a > 0 probability of being selected *i.e. everything has a chance to be selected*. 

::: incremental
- This *chance* is called the **inclusion probability ($\pi_i$)**:
  - $\pi_i$ is **equal** *within* a population unit -- *i.e. all units have the same chance of being selected*.
  - $\pi_i$ **not** necessarily equal *between different* population units -- *i.e. units from different groups may have different chances of being selected* - more on this later.
:::
:::

::: fragment
### How do we perform random sampling in real life?
- **Random number generator** (RNG) -- e.g. R's `sample()` function.
- **Random number table** -- e.g. [Random number table](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2017/04/28/AppenB-HB133-05-Z.pdf) by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
- *Think of it like rolling dice or drawing names from a hat, but using mathematics to ensure true randomness.*

# Interpreting sampled data


## We know that...
### From the previous lecture

- **Sample mean** is a good measure of central tendency (the "middle" of our data).
- **Sample variance** is a good measure of dispersion (how spread out our data is).
- **Sample size** affects the precision of the sample mean (more samples = more precise).

::: fragment
### Can we combine all of the above in a single statistic?
Yes! That's where confidence intervals come in.
:::

# Confidence intervals
![](images/ci-garfield.png)

## Combining an estimate with its precision

A **confidence interval (CI)** is: 

- A range of values that likely contains the true population value
- Like saying "We're 95% confident that out of 100 samples, 95 of them will be within this range"
- Crucial for **hypothesis testing** and **estimation**, the basis of statistical inference

You will often see CIs in scientific papers, reports, and news articles.

## Calculating confidence intervals

### What we need

1. **Estimate** of the population parameter, i.e. the [**sample mean** ($\bar{x}$)]{style="color: #e64626;"} - our best guess of the true value

2. [**Critical value** ($t_{n-1}$)]{style="color: #e64626;"} - a number that represents our chosen confidence level (like 95%)

3. **Standard error** of the estimate, [**SE of the mean** ($SE_{\bar{x}}$)]{style="color: #e64626;"} - tells us how precise our mean is

::: {.callout-note}
Think of standard error as "how much our sample means would vary if we took many different samples and calculated the mean each time"
:::

All these (mean, standard error and critical value) are *combined* to form the confidence interval.

## Breakdown

In general, a CI has the form:
$$\text{estimate} \pm \text{margin of error}$$

where the margin of error is a **function of the standard error** of the estimate:

$$\text{estimate} \pm (\text{critical value} \times \text{standard error (estimate)})$$

where the critical value is based on the **sampling distribution** of the estimate i.e. the **$t$-distribution**.

::: {.callout-tip}
Think of margin of error like the "plus or minus" value you often see in survey results (±3%)
:::

## Formula for 95% Confidence Interval (CI)

$$
\bar{x} \pm \left(t_{n-1} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
$$

### Step-by-step calculation by hand

1. Calculate the sample mean, $\bar{x}$ (add all values and divide by number of samples)

2. Calculate the sample standard deviation, $s$ (measure of spread in your data)

3. Determine the standard error of the mean, $SE_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$ (how precise your mean estimate is)

4. Look up the t-value, $t_{n-1}$, from the t-distribution table for the 95% confidence level and $n-1$ degrees of freedom.
   - This is a specific number based on how many samples you have

5. Compute the margin of error:
  $$\text{Margin of Error} = t_{n-1} \times SE_{\bar{x}}$$

6. Finally, the 95% CI is:
  $$\bar{x} \pm (t_{n-1} \times SE_{\bar{x}})$$


**You need to be able to calculate this by hand/calculator.**

## More definitions

### Degrees of freedom (df)
The number of values in a sample that are free to vary while still maintaining the same statistic.

$$
\text{df} = n - 1
$$

where $n$ is the number of samples. 

::: fragment
### Example
Imagine you have 4 numbers with a mean of 5:

- You can choose the first three numbers freely: 3, 10, and 7
- But the fourth number MUST be 0 to make the mean = 5
  - (3 + 10 + 7 + 0) ÷ 4 = 5
- So only 3 numbers (n-1) can be freely chosen = 3 degrees of freedom
:::

## More definitions

### *t*-critical value
A number that helps determine how wide to make your confidence interval.

- Based on your **confidence level** (e.g. 95%) and **sample size**
- Larger t-values = wider intervals = more confidence but less precision
- Smaller sample sizes = larger t-values (because we're less certain)


## More definitions

### *t*-distribution
A probability distribution that accounts for the uncertainty when estimating from small samples.

- Similar to the normal "bell curve" distribution, but with **heavier tails**.
- With few samples (small n), the t-distribution is wider, reflecting greater uncertainty.
- As sample size increases, the t-distribution gets closer to the normal distribution.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)

# Variable to control animation speed (higher values = slower transitions)
anim_speed <- 1

# Create a sequence of x values for the plot
x <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 400)

# Degrees of freedom: 1 through 5 then even numbers from 6 to 30
dfs <- c(1:5, seq(6, 30, by = 2))

# Prepare data for t-distribution curves with a new "df" column
t_curves <- do.call(rbind, lapply(dfs, function(df) {
    data.frame(
        x = x,
        density = dt(x, df),
        df = df
    )
}))

# Create data for the standard normal distribution (static)
normal_curve <- data.frame(
    x = x,
    density = dnorm(x)
)

# Plot with gganimate: animate t-distribution curves (each frame shows one df)
p <- ggplot() +
    # Static normal distribution curve
    geom_line(
        data = normal_curve, aes(x = x, y = density),
        color = "black", linetype = "dashed", size = 1
    ) +
    # t-distribution curve that will animate
    geom_line(
        data = t_curves, aes(x = x, y = density, color = factor(df)),
        size = 1
    ) +
    labs(
        title = "Degrees of Freedom: {closest_state}",
        x = "x",
        y = "Density",
        subtitle = "Dashed line = Normal distribution; Solid line = t-distribution"
    ) +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    transition_states(states = df, transition_length = anim_speed, state_length = anim_speed)

p
```

::: {.callout-note}
Notice how the t-distribution (solid line) gets closer to the normal distribution (dashed line) as the degrees of freedom increase!
:::

## Interpreting confidence intervals

- Confidence intervals depend on a specified **confidence level** (e.g. 95%, 99%) with higher confidence levels producing wider intervals (i.e. more conservative).
- Another way to think of it: a **range of values** that we are fairly sure contains the true value of the population parameter.

::: fragment
### Fishing analogy

A confidence interval is like a fishing net:

- A wider net (interval) is more likely to catch the fish (true value)
- A spear (single point estimate) is *less* likely to catch the fish
- The net width represents our uncertainty about the true value

::: {.callout-important}
**Common misunderstanding**: A 95% CI does NOT mean there's a 95% chance the true value is inside the interval. It means if you took 100 different samples and made 100 different CIs, about 95 of them would contain the true value.

# Data story: soil carbon
## Soil carbon

![](images/datastory.png)

Soil carbon content was measured at 7 locations across the area. The amount at each location was 48, 56, 90, 78, 86, 71, 42 tonnes per hectare (t/ha).

```{r}
soil <- c(48, 56, 90, 78, 86, 71, 42)
soil
```

**What is the mean soil carbon content and how confident are we in this estimate?** How this is calculated depends on whether we used simple random sampling or stratified random sampling.


# Simple random sampling
Assuming that the soil carbon content is a simple random sample from the population, let's calculate the 95% confidence interval.

## Mean and 95% CI

### Step-by-step calculation

::: incremental
1. Mean: $\bar{x} = \frac{48+56+90+78+86+71+42}{7} \approx 67.3$ t/ha
2. Standard deviation: $s \approx 18.84$ t/ha
   - This tells us how much individual measurements vary from the mean
3. Standard error: $SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{7}} \approx 7.12$ t/ha
   - This tells us how precise our estimate of the mean is
4. t-value (95% CI, df = 6): $t_{0.975,6} \approx 2.447$
   - This is the critical value for 95% confidence with 6 degrees of freedom
5. Margin of error: $t_{0.975,6} \times SE \approx 17.43$ t/ha
   - This is the "plus or minus" value for our interval
6. Which gives: $(67.3 - 17.43, 67.3 + 17.43) = (49.87, 84.73)$ t/ha
:::

::: fragment
And so we report the mean soil carbon content as 67.3 t/ha with a 95% CI of (49.87, 84.73) t/ha or 67.3 ± 17.43 t/ha.

*Note: Our confidence interval is quite wide relative to our mean (about ±26% of the mean value), suggesting moderate uncertainty in our estimate.*
:::


## Implementation in R 


### Manual calculation
```{r}
#| code-fold: false

# Step 1: Calculate the sample mean of soil carbon content
mean_soil <- mean(soil)

# Step 2: Calculate the sample standard deviation of soil carbon content
sd_soil <- sd(soil)

# Step 3: Calculate the standard error of the mean (SE)
se_soil <- sd_soil / sqrt(length(soil))

# Step 4: Calculate the t-critical value for a 95% confidence interval
t_crit <- qt(0.975, df = length(soil) - 1)

# Step 5: Calculate the margin of error (t_crit * SE)
# and then determine the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval
ci <- mean_soil + c(-1, 1) * (t_crit * se_soil)

# Step 6: View the calculated 95% confidence interval
ci

```

There are ways to calculate this in R quickly, but it is important to understand the manual calculation.

::: {.callout-note}
## Understanding the R code
- `mean()` calculates the average value
- `sd()` calculates the standard deviation
- `qt(0.975, df=6)` gives the t-critical value (we use 0.975 because we want 95% in the middle, with 2.5% in each tail)
- `c(-1, 1)` creates a vector to subtract and add the margin of error
:::


## Questions

- How precise is our estimate?
  - *Our margin of error is about 17.43 t/ha, which is roughly 26% of our mean value.*
  
- How big a change must there be to estimate a statistically significant change?
  - *Changes larger than about 17.43 t/ha would likely be statistically significant.*
  
- **Can we sample more efficiently?**
  - *Yes! This is where stratified sampling becomes valuable.*

To answer these questions, we need to compare simple random sampling with a hypothetical stratified random sampling design (i.e. what if we had considered stratification before sampling?)

# Break (10-15 minutes)
*When we return, we'll explore how dividing our sampling area into meaningful groups can improve our precision.*
