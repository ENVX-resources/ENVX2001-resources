## Welcome {.unnumbered}

In this tutorial you will create a **Quarto document** from scratch. By the end you will have an HTML page with formatted text, a chart, and a table --- all inside an RStudio Project.

You will learn how to:

1. Create an RStudio Project and organise your files.
2. Create a Quarto document and set up the YAML header.
3. Write formatted content with headings, lists, and emphasis.
4. Load data, plot a chart, and display a table.

You will work with **one** of these datasets throughout the tutorial. Pick whichever you like and download the CSV --- you will need it shortly.

| Dataset | File | Download |
|---|---|---|
| Studio Ghibli films | `ghibli_films.csv` | [Download](data/ghibli_films.csv) |
| Spotify top songs | `spotify_top50.csv` | [Download](data/spotify_top50.csv) |
| AFL teams | `afl_teams.csv` | [Download](data/afl_teams.csv) |
| Fast food chains | `fast_food.csv` | [Download](data/fast_food.csv) |


# RStudio Projects

RStudio Projects keep all your files in one place and set your working directory automatically. This means you can use relative paths (like `data/myfile.csv`) instead of full file paths, making your code portable across computers.

## Exercise 1: Set up your project {.unnumbered}

Follow along as the tutor demonstrates each step.

1. Open RStudio.
2. Go to **File > New Project... > New Directory > New Project**.
3. Name the project something like `tutorial01` and choose where to save it.
4. Inside the project, create a folder called `data`. You can do this in the **Files** pane (bottom-right) by clicking **New Folder**.
5. Move your chosen CSV file into the `data` folder.

::: {.column-margin}
If you are not sure how to move files, open your system's file manager (Finder on Mac, File Explorer on Windows) and drag the CSV into the `data` folder you just created.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Checkpoint
You should have an RStudio Project open with a `data/` folder containing your chosen CSV file. Check the **Files** pane to confirm.
:::


# Quarto Basics

Quarto documents combine text and code into a single file that renders to HTML, PDF, or Word. The document starts with a **YAML header** (the block between `---` markers) that controls the title, author, and output settings.

## Exercise 2: Create your document {.unnumbered}

1. Go to **File > New File > Quarto Document...** and click **Create Empty Document**.
2. Copy the following YAML header into the top of your file:

```yaml
---
title: "Exploring My Dataset"
author: "Your Name"
date: today
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    toc: true
---
```

3. Save the file as `report.qmd` in your project folder.
4. Render the document with **Cmd+Shift+K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+K** (Windows/Linux).

::: {.column-margin}
Other themes worth trying later: `flatly`, `journal`, `darkly`. The full list is at [quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html).
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Checkpoint
You should see a rendered HTML page with your title, your name, today's date, and an empty body. If you get an error, check that the YAML is indented exactly as shown above.
:::


# Writing in Quarto

The rest of the tutorial builds up the body of your document. Each exercise adds a new section. Render after each one to see your progress.

## Exercise 3: Write about your data {.unnumbered}

Add some text below the YAML header. Write a short commentary on your dataset --- pick out some items that stand out to you and explain why. Use the markdown formatting shown below as a guide.

```markdown
## About the data

### My top picks

**[Item]** stands out because...

### Also worth a look

A few more that caught my eye:

- [Item 1] --- reason
- [Item 2] --- reason

### Surprises

*[Item]* was lower than I expected...
```

This section uses several markdown formatting features:

- `##` and `###` create section headings at different levels.
- `**text**` makes text **bold**.
- `*text*` makes text *italic*.
- Lines starting with `-` create bullet lists.

Render the document to check that your headings, bold text, and lists appear correctly.

::: {.callout-note}
## Checkpoint
Your rendered document should show formatted text with proper headings, bold and italic styling, and a bullet list. The table of contents on the right should list your new sections.
:::

## Exercise 4: Load and display your data {.unnumbered}

Now let's bring in the dataset. Add a **setup chunk** first, then a chunk to load and display the data. Replace the file name with whichever CSV you chose.

````
```{{r}}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
```
````

````
```{{r}}
#| label: data

my_data <- read_csv("data/ghibli_films.csv")
my_data
```
````

A few things to note:

- The `#|` lines are **chunk options**. They control how the chunk behaves when you render.
- `message: false` and `warning: false` stop package loading messages from cluttering your output.
- `read_csv()` reads your CSV file into R. The path is relative to your project folder.

::: {.column-margin}
If you see an error like "file does not exist", double-check that your CSV is inside the `data/` folder and that the file name matches exactly (including capitalisation).
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Checkpoint
After rendering, you should see the tidyverse loading code followed by your data printed as a table. Every row from your CSV should be visible.
:::

## Exercise 5: Create a chart {.unnumbered}

Add a code chunk that creates a horizontal bar chart of your data. The example below uses the Ghibli dataset --- adjust the column names to match your chosen dataset.

````
```{{r}}
#| label: fig-chart
#| fig-cap: "A quick look at the data"
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 5

ggplot(my_data, aes(x = reorder(title, rating), y = rating)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Rating")
```
````

What's happening here:

- `reorder(title, rating)` sorts the bars so the highest-rated item is at the top.
- `coord_flip()` turns the chart on its side, making the labels easier to read.
- `fig-cap` adds a caption below the figure.
- `fig-width` and `fig-height` control the plot dimensions in inches.

If you are not using the Ghibli dataset, you will also need to update the `labs()` line to match your axis label (e.g. `y = "Streams (millions)"` for Spotify, `y = "Premierships"` for AFL).

::: {.column-margin}
**Column names for each dataset:**

- Ghibli: `title`, `rating`
- Spotify: `title`, `streams_millions`
- AFL: `team`, `premierships`
- Fast food: `name`, `rating`
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Checkpoint
You should see a horizontal bar chart with items sorted from lowest to highest, plus a caption underneath. If the bars are unsorted, check that you used `reorder()` correctly.
:::

## Exercise 6: Add a formatted table {.unnumbered}

Finally, add a clean summary table. This time we will hide the code so the reader only sees the output --- just like you would in a real report.

````
```{{r}}
#| label: tbl-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Dataset overview"
#| echo: false

knitr::kable(my_data)
```
````

The new option here is `echo: false`, which hides the code chunk from the rendered output. The reader sees the table but not the R code that produced it. This is how you would typically present results in a report or assignment.

Try going back to your chart chunk (Exercise 5) and adding `echo: false` there too, then re-render. Notice how the document looks cleaner without the code blocks.

::: {.callout-note}
## Checkpoint
Your document should now include a formatted table with a caption and no visible code. If you also hid the chart code, the document should read like a finished report.
:::

# Putting it all together

Take a moment to look at what you have. Starting from an empty project, you have created a Quarto document that includes:

- A YAML header with a title, author, date, and output settings.
- Written prose with headings, bold, italic, and lists.
- A code chunk that loads and displays a dataset.
- A chart with a caption.
- A formatted table with hidden code.

This is the same workflow you will use for labs and assignments throughout the semester: set up a project, write a document, bring in data, and present your results.

## Other output formats {.unnumbered}

So far you have been rendering to HTML. Quarto can also produce Word documents and PDFs from the same `.qmd` file --- your tutor will demonstrate this now.

To render a Word document, change the `format` section of your YAML header:

```yaml
format:
  docx:
    toc: true
```

To render a PDF (using Typst), change it to:

```yaml
format:
  typst:
    toc: true
```

Render after each change and compare the output. The same content works across all three formats --- you only change the YAML.

::: {.column-margin}
If you want to go back to HTML afterwards, change `format` back to the original `html` block from Exercise 2.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Checkpoint
You should have seen your document rendered as both a Word file and a PDF. The content is the same --- only the output format changed.
:::

This tutorial page itself is a Quarto document. You can view its source code by clicking the **Code** dropdown (top-right of the page) and selecting **View Source**. Everything you see here --- the text, the layout, the formatting --- is written in a `.qmd` file, just like the one you created today.

If you want to keep exploring, the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/) has more on output formats, cross-references, and interactive features.
